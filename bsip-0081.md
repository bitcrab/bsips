# Abstract
[BSIP67](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/issues/130) proposed a mechanism
which has maker-taker fees in consideration, but it's relatively complex.

This BSIP proposes a protocol change to enable asset owners to specify
different market fee rate for maker orders and taker orders.

# Motivation

Asset owners need tools to incentivize trading of their assets.

# Rationale

Maker-taker fee model is adopted widely in centralized exchanges and helped
them to attract trading activities.

# Specification

There is already a flag `market_fee_percent` in asset options.

Add a new flag `taker_fee_percent` into asset options, assign
`market_fee_percent` to `taker_fee_percentage` at the consensus
upgrade time for existing assets. The new flag can only be set
or updated by asset owners after the consensus upgrade.

Before the consensus upgrade, when an order buying that asset
got filled, the amount `bought_amount * market_fee_percent`
will go to the asset's accumulated fees.

After the consensus upgrade, when an order buying the asset
got filled,
* if the order is a *maker*, the amount
  `bought_amount * market_fee_percent` will go to the
  asset's accumulated fees;
* otherwise (if the order is a *taker*), the amount
  `bought_amount * taker_fee_percent` will go to the
  asset's accumulated fees.
