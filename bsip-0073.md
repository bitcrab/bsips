# Abstract

This BSIP proposes a protocol change to improve user experience (UX) of
force-settlements by trying to fill force-settlement orders
(*settle orders* in short) at a better price
and optionally fill them before expiration when certain conditions are met.

# Motivation

Force-settlements were designed for debt asset holders to convert an amount
of the debt asset into corresponding collateral asset at a fair price *when
there is nobody willing to buy back the debt at a fair price*.

To mitigate malious behavior and market manipulation, a *delay* and a *price
offset* were designed. But the mechanism has flaws.
* If a positive *offset* is configured in the debt asset's options,
  force-settlement requesters will always "buy expensive" even when there are
  orders "selling low". This also leads to occasional spikes in the market
  history charts.
* Force-settlement requesters have to wait for the *delay* even when there
  appear traders buying the debt asset at a fair price in the market.

These flaws have led to certain confusion and anger among market participants.

# Rationale

Actually, when a margin call appears, it means there is somebody
willing to buy back the debt. Thus, it makes sense to fill the margin calls
with the settle orders.

Similarly, if there are limit orders selling the debt asset
below the feed price,
it makes sense to match the limit orders with the settle orders as well.

When one of these opportunities appears, it makes sense to fill certain
settle orders immediately if it's desired by the owners of the settle orders.

These changes would improve user experience (UX).

# Specifications

## Protocol upgrade

A time will need to be scheduled for applying the change. In this document,
terms "before the protocol upgrade", "at the protocol upgrade" and "after
the protocol upgrade" may or may not be used to indicate things happen before
the scheduled time, at the scheduled time and after the scheduled time.

## `settle_order_object`

The `settle_order_object` stores current status of a force-settlement order.

A new field is needed within it:

* `bool fill_asap;`

By default this field is set to `false`, which means the order will be
processed after the *delay* defined in the asset's options, which is current
behavior.

If this field is set to `true`, the order will be filled or partially filled
when a debt position enters margin call territory. It will also be filled or
partially filled when someone places a limit order selling the collateral
asset below the feed price.

If multiple settle orders with this field as `true` exist in the market,
when filling before the *delay*, the order which was created first will be
filled first.

## `asset_settle_operation`

The `asset_settle_operation` is used to request a force-settlement. It has
an `extensions` field:

* `extensions_type     extensions;`

The data type of this field needs to be overridden so that it can include the
new `fill_asap` option.

## `asset_settle_evaluator`

The `asset_settle_evaluator` is used to evaluate and apply the
`asset_settle_operation`. New logic is needed:
* only allow `fill_asap` option to be set after the protocol upgrade;
* if the `fill_asap` option is specified in an `asset_settle_operation`, when
  creating a `settle_order_object` (note: it implies some conditions are met,
  E.G. the asset is not globally settled), assign the value of the operation's
  `fill_asap` field to the object's `fill_asap` field.
* if the `fill_asap` option is set to `true`, and if the feed price is valid,
  after creation of the settle order object, try to match it against the order
  book immediately. In other words, treat it as a taker limit order buying
  at the feed price.

## `proposal_create_evaluator`

The `proposal_create_evaluator` is used to evaluate and apply the
`proposal_create_operation`, which can contain zero or more
`asset_settle_operation` objects. New logic is needed:
* only allow `fill_asap` to be set after the protocol upgrade.

## Matching and filling settle orders whose `fill_asap` field is `true`

### When a new limit order is created

If the new limit order is selling the collateral asset for the debt asset, and
its price is below the feed price (which implies the feed price is valid),
* current logic is to only match it with the limit orders on the opposite side
  of the market;
* after the protocol upgrade, the new logic would be:
  * firstly match it with the limit orders on the opposite side whose buy
    prices are higher than the feed price;
  * secondly match it with the settle orders whose `fill_asap` options were
    set to `true`. The matching price would be the feed price. In other words,
    treat the settle orders as maker limit orders buying at the feed price;
  * lastly match it with remaining limit orders on the opposite side.

### When a debt position enters margin call territory

If a margin call order appears, either due to the feed price changing, or due
to the amount of collateral or the amount of debt changing (which implies the
feed price is valid),
* current logic is to only match it with the limit orders on the opposite
  side of the market and conditionally trigger a black swan event;
* after the protocol upgrade, the new logic would be:
  * firstly match it with the limit orders on the opposite side whose buy
    prices are higher than the feed price; if this step triggers a black swan
    event, apply the corresponding black swan processing logic to the market;
  * secondly match it with the settle orders whose `fill_asap` options were
    set to `true`. The matching price would be the feed price. In other words,
    treat the settle orders as maker limit orders buying at the feed price;
  * lastly match it with remaining limit orders on the opposite side (which
    would possibly trigger a black swan event as well, but it's out of this
    document's scope).

### When the feed price changes

When the feed price changes, either due to a new price being published, or due
to an old price expiring, or due to the asset's options changing, if the new
feed price is valid, and if the new feed price in the direction of "X debt
asset per collateral asset" is higher than the old feed price or the old feed
price was invalid,
* current logic doesn't handle settle orders,
* after the protocol upgrade, the new logic would be:
  * if there are limit orders selling the collateral asset below the new feed
    price, and there are settle orders whose `fill_asap` options were `true`,
    match the settle orders with the limit orders. In other words, treat
    those settle orders as taker limit orders buying at the new feed price.

### Do not update `force_settled_volume` when filling the `fill_asap` orders

When a settle order is filled or partially filled due to having the
`fill_asap` option set to `true`,
it doesn't affect `force_settled_volume` (which indicates how much of the debt
asset has been force-settled in the current maintenance interval).

## Processing settle orders after the delay

Currently, when filling a settle order after the delay (note: it implies
some conditions are met, E.G. the feed price is valid and total settled volume
in the current maintenance interval doesn't exceed the maximum allowed volume),
the settle order will be matched against the debt position with the least
collateral ratio, the fill price in the direction of "X debt asset
per collateral asset" would be
`fill_price = feed_price * (1 + foce_settlement_offset)`.

After the protocol upgrade, when processing a settle order after the delay,
* firstly try to match it with the margin calls and the limit orders selling
  below `fill_price`. In other words, treat it as a taker limit order buying
  at `fill_price`.
  Note: this step doesn't affect `force_settled_volume`.
* if the settle order still exists, process it with the logic before the
  protocol upgrade.
  Note: this step does affect `force_settled_volume` as before.

## Logic related to BSIP 71 (Prevent Global Settlement)

The behaviors proposed in this BSIP would be impacted by BSIP 71.

In general, this BSIP proposes that
* the settle orders whose `fill_asap` field is `true` will be treated as
  limit orders buying at feed price when the market engine processing
  limit orders or margin calls, and
* when processing a settle order after the delay, it will "buy the way up"
  before being matched with a debt position that need to apply
  `force_settlement_offset`.

## API

APIs which return `settle_order_object` need to return the new `fill_asap`
field in the `settle_order_object`.

APIs which return a combined order book can combine settle orders whose
`fill_asap` is true with the limit orders on the same side of the market.

## CLI

Currently there is a `settle_asset` command in CLI which can be used to
create force-settlement orders. After the protocol upgrade,
we need a command in
CLI for users to create force-settlement orders with the new `fill_asap`
option.

One option is to add an optional boolean parameter to the parameter list of
the existing `settle_asset` command, if it doesn't break existing client
applications which rely on that wallet API. Otherwise, a new command is
needed, E.G. `settle_asset_ext`.

## GUI/UX

Note: GUI changes here are only suggestions, formally they're not part of the
specification.

The new `fill_asap` option needs to be presented and can be used in GUI after
the protocol upgrade.

When there are settle orders with `fill_asap` option set to `true`, the UI
can show them
as special buy orders which are buying at the feed price in the order book.

# Discussion

* With this BSIP, we provided a tool that can be used by debt asset holders to
convert their debt asset holdings into corresponding collateral asset more
conveniently and flexibly.
However, it's not guaranteed that a settle order will be filled at a better
price if the owner choose to fill it "as soon as possible". Market paticipants
should always make their own decisions on whether to use the new tool.

* From the perspective of the debt asset owners (note: "asset owners" and
"asset holders" have different meanings), for the performance of the debt
assets, it could be more desirable to execute force-settlements against margin
calls than against market orders, because it would improve the overall
collateral ratio of the asset (although it's in the price of worse experience
for force-settlement requesters). In that sense it contradicts the goals of
BSIP 71 (Prevent Global Settlement).

* The proposed functionality is mostly convenience for users. Manual selling on
the market is (almost) always available when it would be used automatically
by this proposal (exception: new incoming limit orders).

* The proposed functionality complicates the market engine and possibly the
`get_order_book` call (see [bitshares/bitshares-core#1958](
https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/issues/1958)).
It is probably harmful for performance in the long run, which is particularly
undesirable for functionality that can mostly be emulated client-side.

# Non-Technical Summary

When force-settling a SmartCoin, the user currently has to wait for the
*settlement delay* before her tokens are exchanged for the collateral asset.
This BSIP introduces a new flag that allows settlement requests to be matched
with market orders during the waiting period, potentially resulting in faster
settlement and a better price. It complicates the market engine thus will
impact performance.
