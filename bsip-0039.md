# Abstract

On the BitShares Blockchain, proposals allow to gather signatures for a
multisignature-setup by means of on-chain approvals. In contrast to
other blockchains, these proposals are actually stored on the blockchain
and automatically executed once the required amount of approvals has
been reached. This allows participants of a multisignature-setup to
exchange insufficiently signed transactions easily.

However, when creating a new proposal, the proposer needs to manually
approve his operation afterwards. This is not only inconvenient, but
also costs and additional operation and thus a fee.

This BSIP proposes a protocol change that enables the proposer of a
proposal to automatically added herself as approved.

# Motivation

In the case of a simple 2-of-3 multisig-scheme, today's implementation
forces us to have 3 operations stored on the blockchain: a) the proposal
itself, and two approvals.

The inconvenience and additional fee hinders adoption of this scheme and
makes it unnecessary complicated.

Due to lacking of an auto-approval feature, an ignorant user might fire a
`proposal_create` operation to create a proposal and then immediately fire
a `proposal_update` (i.e. approve) operation to approve the proposal.
However, the final proposal ID is not known before the `proposal_create`
operation is beyond the last irreversible block. So the user might
inadvertently approve the wrong proposal.
On Monday, 20th December 2018, [a node crash incident
](https://www.bitshares.foundation/announcements/2018-12-21-proposal-incident)
was indirectly caused by this.

# Rational

Giving the proposer an option to automatically approve the proposal
after creation solves the issue.

If the proposer is not part of the multisig-setup, having him approve
the proposal automatically does not affect the validity of the proposal
itself.

For backward compatibility, to avoid breaking existing applications,
It's good to keep the default behavior.

# Specifications

Add an extension to the `proposal_create_operation` that let the proposer
define whether to auto-approve the proposal after creation. If the
extension is not present, do not auto-approve. The extension can only be
used after a scheduled protocol upgrade time.

# Discussion

By proposing an action, sometimes the proposer can be considered as an
agreeing party, otherwise the proposal wouldn't have been created in
the first place. Since sometimes the proposer doesn't want to approve
immediately, it's better that she has an option to decide whether to
auto-approve.

# Non-technical Summary

This BSIP proposes a minor modification that improves the process of
using hierarchical account permissions and simplifies the use of
multisig-setups with only minimal modifications.
