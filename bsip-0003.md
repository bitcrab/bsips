# Abstract

Under this proposal, an asset issuer could enable a flag on their asset that
would not charge any market fees for open orders. The market fee would only be
charged to the taker (the individual whose new order is actively being matched).

# Motivation

This would incentivise people to leave orders on the books (it is cheaper). The
only person who would pay a fee would be the one who wants immediate liquidity.

# Specifications

# Discussion

Since this feature does nothing unless the asset issuer updates the asset flags
to enable this feature, we can leave it to the committee to decide (as this is a
fee related question). In this way the community (via committee) has control.
