# Abstract

This BSIP proposes a protocol change which aims to improve overall collaretal ratio (CR) of smartcoins.

# Motivation

Risk-loving traders tend to borrow as much debt as possible with as little collateral as possible,
which impacts overall CR of that smartcoin. Smartcoin owners would like to have a tool to counter
this behavior.

# Rationale

Requiring a higher CR for new debt positions would introduce a buffer thus would increase the
stability of the smartcoin.

# Specification

Add one parameter "Initial Collateral Ratio" (ICR) to each smartcoin asset, which can be updated by the asset owner.

When adjusting a position, apply [BSIP30](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0030.md)
if current CR is lower than ICR but not MCR.

Before the protocol upgrade:
```
when creating a new debt position
  require CR > MCR

when adjusting a debt position
  if new CR <= MCR
    require CR increased and debt not increased

when current CR <= MCR
  trigger margin call
```

After the protocol upgrade:
```
Require ICR >= MCR

when creating a new debt position
  require CR > ICR

when adjusting a debt position
  if new CR <= ICR
    require CR increased and debt not increased

when current CR <= MCR
  trigger margin call
```

Note: logic around *target collateral ratio* (TCR) is not affected.

# Discussion

This BSIP introduces a new tool for smartcoin asset owners to fine tune their assets.
Having an ICR greater than MCR would probably result in less risk-loving traders borrowing that
smartcoin, thus may lead to fewer market activities and worse liquidity. It's up to the asset owners
to decide whether to use this tool.
