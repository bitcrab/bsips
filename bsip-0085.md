# Abstract

This BSIP proposes a protocol change so that the committee can define
different transaction fee rates for maker orders and taker orders.

# Motivation

To improve liquidity of the BitShares DEX by creating the ability to incentivize market making.

# Rationale

The maker-taker fee model is adopted widely in centralized exchanges and
helped them to attract trading activities.

In the BitShares DEX, for each filled order, the owner of the order need to
pay an order creation fee and conditionally a market fee.
[BSIP 81](bsip-0081.md) described
a way to apply the maker-taker fee model to the market fee. This BSIP
describes a way to apply the maker-taker fee model to the order creation fee.

# Specification

Add a new global parameter `maker_fee_discount_percent` which can
be updated by the committee only after the protocol upgrade.
Initial value of that parameter is `0`.
Valid range of that parameter is `[0, 100%]`.

When a limit order is filled or partially filled for the first time,
technically, when its `deferred_fee` field is non-zero,
* if the order is a take order, process the deferred fee as before;
* if the order is a maker order, 
  * if the order creation fee was paid in BTS, return
  `round_down(deferred_fee * maker_fee_discount_percent)` to the owner,
  then process the remaining deferred fee as before;
  * if the order creation fee was paid in another asset, return
  `round_down(deferred_paid_fee * maker_fee_discount_percent)`
  to the owner, return
  `round_down(deferred_fee * maker_fee_discount_percent)` to
  the fee pool of the asset, then process the remaining deferred fee
  and deferred paid fee as before.

# Discussion

As of writing, to incentivize market making, the `limit_order_create`
operation fee is very small. However, since there is only one fee,
the fee for consuming liqudity is also very small.
This BSIP gives the committee a tool to increase fee for consuming
liquidity while still keeping a low cost for market makers to provide
liquidity.
